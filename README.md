# Projec_Abyss (Game)

The final project for my last coding class back in college. 

It is a full game made completely from scratch without using a game engine, that is to say, it runs on QT's user interface libraries (yes, really).

## The concept
The initial idea was to make a game similar to The Binding of Isaac, with tons of items and procedurally generated levels. Obviously, I didn't have enough time to make what I wanted so it had to be toned down quite a bit, but the basic concept stayed the same.

## The items
The game has 95 items with 24 of them being unknown items (they have a question mark sprite and are indistinguishable from each other before picking them up).
Items can modify the player stats but also give them effects such as slow fall, super speed, inverted controls, inverted gravity, double or triple shot, etc.
Every level has two guaranteed items, but more can be dropped by enemies. Items are selected by the game when a new run starts.

## The levels
The game gas three levels with fixed enemy and room layouts. Level one is a cave, level two is a mausoleum and level three is the abyss.

## The bosses
Each level has a boss at the end. Boss one is a giant snake with fixed movement patterns, boss two is an evil priest that jumps in the middle of the room a shoots on random patterns, and boss three is an ancient horror that has random movement and shooting patterns.

## Local multiplayer
The game allows for local coop with player one using the classic WASD controls and player two using the arrow keys and jumping and shooting with the mouse.

## Additional features
The game allow for saving a reloading runs, even if you close the game.
